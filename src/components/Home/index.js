        My name is Pooja Arshanapally. I am a designer interested in a multitude
        of arts such as UI/UX design, web design, graphic design, video
        production and much more. I am passionate about communicating through
        design to a variety of audiences. Due to my coding experience, I am able
        to think logically at situations and fix the problems. Because of my
        hobbies such as photography has given me a keen eye when it comes to
        design. Both of these assets has made me realize my true niche.
